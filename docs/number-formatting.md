# Number Formatting

- Thousands separator (12,345). Decimal point (12.3).
- Percentages always include `%` (e.g., 7%); round to whole unless precision adds meaning.
- Currency: `A$` on first mention; `$` thereafter when unambiguous. Use `m`/`bn` (e.g., $2.5bn).
- Negative values use the minus sign and red; positives may use green where helpful.
- Dates: YYYY for yearly; `Jan`, `Feb` for monthly series.
